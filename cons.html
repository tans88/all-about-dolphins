        <p class="body" id="cons-intro">Dolphins are an important part of the oceans. They help keep the squid and fish population balanced 
            and also provide food for other predators, like big species of sharks. Without them, the fish and squid population would grow 
            uncontrollably and their predators would have no food to eat. This would damage the entire food chain, causing mass extinction 
            among many different species that keep the oceans healthy and diverse. Right now, the biggest threat to dolphins involves 
            human-related activities like drive hunts and bycatch.</p>

        <p class="headers" id="drive-hunt-title"> DOLPHIN DRIVE HUNTS </p>

        <p class="body" id="drive-hunt-body"> Dolphin drive hunts are the process of hunting dolphins by rounding groups up into a small 
            area (usually a bay or shallow area of water). This method of hunting is carried out in the Soloman Islands, Peru, and 
            most popularly, Japan. After rounding the dolphins up, hunters either slaughter the dolphins to sell for their meat or 
            sell them to dolphinariums. A dolphinarium is an aquariums for dolphins. They are kept in pools or in small pens in the ocean, 
            and are put on display for the public or may be used to perform tricks for entertainment. One of the most popular dolphinariums 
            is SeaWorld, which has used dolphins for public entertainment since 1973.</p>

        <p class="headers" id="bycatch-title"> BYCATCH </p>

        <p class="body" id="bycatch-body"> Bycatch is the unintentional capture of marine animals while fishing for a specific size or 
            species of wildlife. Bycatch can be sea turtles, seabirds, whales, or dolphins. These animals get caught in the nets, 
            preventing them from reaching the surface for air, essentially drowning them. In addition, sometimes nets can wrap around 
            dolphins' bodies for several months, making it harder for them to hunt or move around. Bycatch is the leading threat to 
            dolphins and whales, causing at least 300,000 deaths per year. While some solutions do exist, like modifying nets so that 
            fewer non-target animals are caught, no sustainable method exists to substantially reduce bycatch. The only way, as of right
             now, to significantly reduce bycatch, would be for more people to stop eating fish. If the demand for fish goes down, 
             then the amount of fishing will also go down, therefore, reducing the amount of bycatch.</p>
