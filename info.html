            <p class="questions" id="q-one">HOW SMART ARE DOLPHINS?</p>

            <p class="body" id="intelligence-one">
                Dolphins are among the smartest animals in the world. Their intelligence can be measured on a 
                pod's (a group of dolphins) ability to communicate with each other as well as their ability to think cognitively 
                and solve problems.</p>

            <p class="body" id="intelligence-two"> 
                In terms of their communication abilities, dolphins communicate much like humans do. Dolphins communicate by using different 
                clicks and whistles. Clicking allows them to echolocate, helping them find other dolphin pods, food, or any dangers ahead. 
                Different dolphin pods have variations of clicks and whistles, much like different languages.</p>

            <p class="body" id="intelligence-three"> Dolphins also use a variety of tools to help them retrieve food at ease. One example of 
                this is through a method known as "shelling". Dolphins use shells that they find as a "net" to trap small animals. They then 
                stick their beak into the opening of the shell and allow its contents to slide right into their mouths. Another method, 
                called "sponging," involves the use of sea sponges. Dolphins, in order to protect their beaks when digging in the sand for 
                food, slip the sponges over their beaks in order to guard themselves. This allows them to dig their beaks 
                deeper into the sand. </p>

            <p class="questions" id="q-two">HOW MANY SPECIES OF DOLPHINS ARE THERE?</p>

            <p class="body" id="species-one"> There are 44 known species of dolphins that exist today. A handful of these species, however, live 
                exclusively in rivers. These species have their own unique qualities that differentiate them from others, and scientists 
                are constantly discovering more as the world's oceans are explored further. Here are a few of the most unique species:</p>

            <p class="headers" id="orca-header">KILLER WHALES</p>
            <p class="body" id="orcas">Believe it or not, killer whales are a part of the dolphin family. These whales, also called orcas, are the 
                largest dolphins in the world, weighing an average of 8000-12000 pounds for males and 3000-6000 pounds for females. 
                Not only are they the largest dolphin species, but also the most social. In fact, many orca calves live with their mothers, 
                siblings, and grandmothers for life! </p>

            <p class="headers" id="river-header"> AMAZON RIVER DOLPHINS </p>
            <p class="body" id="river-one"> Amazon river dolphins are one of five different species that live in rivers instead of oceans. 
                The most unique quality of this species of dolphin is their skin color. Yes, dolphins come in many different colors 
                including black, white, and gray. However, what is so special about the amazon river dolphin is that it is pink! 
                These pink dolphins, also called botos, are actually born gray, but they start to turn pinker they mature.</p>
            <p class="body" id="river dolphins"> Their coloration is not the only unique thing about them. Unlike other dolphins, the vertebrae in 
                their necks are unfused. This means that they are able to turn their necks 90 degrees, allowing them to avoid obstacles 
                like trees or rocks that are often found in the waters they inhabit.</p>

            <p class ="headers" id="spotted-header"> ATLANTIC SPOTTED DOLPHINS </p>
            <p class="body" id="spotted">Atlantic spotted dolphins as the name suggests, are covered in "freckles" all throughout their bodies. 
                They are not born with these spots, however. As the dolphin matures, the spots form around their body. These spots can be 
                thought of as wrinkles for these dolphins, showing their age depending on the number of spots visible.</p>

            alt="spotted dolphin">

            <p class="headers" id="spinner-header"> SPINNER DOLPHINS </p>
            <p class="body" id="spinners">Known as the acrobats of the oceans, spinner dolphins are best known for their rapid spinning as they 
                leap out of the water. These dolphins use the power from their tails to drive their spinning motion, allowing them to 
                twirl up to seven times in one leap! As they prepare to jump, they beat their tails at a rapid pace and use their muscles 
                to spin their bodies in the air. They use these spins to communicate with each other, watch for potential hazards, 
                rid their bodies of dirt or parasites, or to simply have fun.</p>

        <div class="behavior"> 

            <p class="questions" id="q-three"> HOW DO DOLPHINS BEHAVE? </p>

            <p class="body" id="b-one"> Dolphin behavior varies depending on the time of day, their physiological condition, the condition of the 
                other dolphins around them, and the condition of their habitat. All of these factors play a vital role in determining 
                how a dolphin may behave at a certain moment.</p>

            <p class="body" id="b-two"> Dolphins are active day and night, but mainly in the mornings and afternoons. When dolphins sleep, they sleep 
                with one eye open to watch for predators or other dangers. This means that only one hemisphere of their brains is asleep 
                at a time, while the other is active. Sleeping with one eye open also keeps them from drowning since they eventually have 
                to go to the surface for air. Dolphins in captivity, however, have completely different sleeping behaviors 
                than wild dolphins. They keep their blowholes (breathing holes) above the water and do not respond to any light stimuli. 
                They appear to be in a much deeper sleep than wild dolphins because they do not have to worry about predators.</p>

            <p class="body" id="b-three"> Dolphins are highly social animals and form strong bonds with the other dolphins around them. They form 
                connections with their mothers, siblings, and the other members of their pods. Much like human beings, they form 
                friendships with one another based on common interests. For example, Shark Bay is home to dolphins known as "spongers," 
                who use sea sponges to protect their beaks when looking for food. Data collected from observing the dolphins in the bay 
                showed that the male dolphins in the area tended to associate more closely with other male spongers than with non-spongers. 
                Through these common interests, male dolphins form connections with other male dolphins, often resulting in friendships 
                or alliances that can last decades.</p>

                <img id="b-p-two" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Delphinus_delphis_with_calf.jpg" alt="common dolphin with calf">
            </div>
            
            <p class="body" id="b-four"> There is also evidence that shows that dolphins may grieve the death of other dolphins. 
                It is unclear whether or not dolphins understand the finality of death, but grief-like behavior has been 
                observed by scientists. Records have shown that a female dolphin may carry around her dead calf's carcass for 
                several hours or days, while other observations have shown dolphins circling around deceased companions. 
                A blog post at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/" 
                style="text-decoration: none; color:rgb(54, 186, 173);"><em><strong>National Geographic</strong></em></a> discusses 
                an encounter with an adult striped dolphin, in which grieving behavior was observed. The encounter, which 
                was <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/173754101" 
                style="text-decoration: none; color:rgb(54, 186, 173);"><strong>caught on camera</strong></a>, 
                showed the striped dolphin circling around and carrying his deceased female companion, exhibiting strong emotion. 
                Due to the number of years dolphins spend together in pods (around 60 or more) as well as their highly developed 
                brains and social abilities, scientists believe that dolphins do feel some form of grief. </p>

            <p class="body" id="b-five"> Although beloved for their cute and playful personalities, dolphins have a dark side as well. Their 
                reproductive behaviors can be aggressive at times as male dolphins may sometimes gang up on a female, forcing her to 
                mate with them. Male dolphins may also get sexually aggressive with animals other than dolphins, even humans. 
                In addition, a male sometimes kills a baby dolphin, also called a calf, in an attempt to mate with the mother. 
                Since females only have one calf at a time, killing the calf makes the mother immediately ready for her next pregnancy.</p>
