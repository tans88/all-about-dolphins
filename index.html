    <h1>Dolphins: The Most Intelligent Underwater Creatures</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p id="intro-one">
      Dolphins are apart of the Cetacea group of aquatic mammals. This group not only includes dolphins, but other ocean mammals including 
      whales and porpoises. </p>

    <p id="intro-two">
      There are currently about 44 different species of dolphins that exist and scientists are constantly discovering more. 
      These species are spread out across the globe, with different skin colors, behaviors, and habitats. The most popular of these 
      species is the Bottlenose dolphin.</p>
    
    <p id="intro-three">
      Dolphins are carnivorous creatures that eat a variety of fish, jellyfish, squid, and small octopuses.They use many different unique, 
      yet effective methods of capture. For example, they use their powerful tails to kick up the dust near the ocean floor to disorientate 
      their prey, allowing the dolphins to swoop in and grab them. This is a technique known as hydroplaning. Another method involves a 
      large fish known as a yellowtail jack. These fish are much too large for the animals to be able to eat whole. Instead, dolphins grab 
      these fish by their tails and slam them against the water's surface, causing them to split into multiple small pieces. 
      Their intelligence and teamworking abilities allow them to come up with a variety of effective strategies to maximize their 
      food intake.</p>
